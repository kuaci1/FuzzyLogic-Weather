Weather Prediction using Fuzzy Logic SystemsThis repository contains the Final Project for the Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals course (Group 6 - Even Semester 2024/2025).The project implements and compares various Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Making methods to predict weather conditions based on historical weather data.
Project OverviewThe goal of this project is to predict the weather summary (e.g., Clear, Cloudy, Overcast) using three input variables: Temperature, Humidity, and Wind Speed.
We implemented and compared four different methods:Fuzzy Mamdani (Min-Max Inference)Fuzzy Sugeno (Linear Output)Fuzzy Tsukamoto (Weighted Average)SAW (Simple Additive Weighting) 
DatasetThe dataset used is Weather History (e.g., from Szegedin, Hungary 2006-2016).Source: weatherHistory.csvPreprocessing:Handling missing values (Median imputation).Outlier removal using the IQR method.Normalization (MinMaxScaler).Data reduction to focus on top weather labels: Clear, Partly Cloudy, Mostly Cloudy, Overcast. 
Methodology 1. FuzzificationWe define Trapezoidal Membership Functions (trapmf) for the input variables:Temperature (°C): Cold (Dingin), Normal, Hot (Panas).Humidity (0-1): Low (Rendah), Medium (Sedang), High (Tinggi).Wind Speed (km/h): Weak (Lemah), Medium (Sedang), Strong (Kencang).2. Fuzzy RulesThe system uses a set of linguistic rules, for example:IF Temperature is Hot AND Humidity is Low AND Wind is Weak THEN Weather is Clear.3. Inference MethodsMamdani: Uses Min (AND) for implication and Max (OR) for aggregation.Sugeno: Calculates a crisp score using a linear formula: $Score = 0.6(T) - 0.4(H) - 0.2(W)$.Tsukamoto: Uses monotonic membership functions for outputs and calculates the weighted average.SAW: A scoring method based on normalized benefit/cost attributes.
